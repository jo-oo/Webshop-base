## Aim

The aim of this application is to build a base for a webshop displaying product data that functions as a starting point when building any webshop.
It contains a basic product/s grid and products and product/id-routes, products service (calling Fakestore API: https://fakestoreapi.com), as well as a home page and a navigation bar. All responsive.

## Purpose

I wanted a foundational responsive layout, functions and routes in place for any webshop to build on to as an own application. 
It can be challenging to identify the fundamentals when you're immersed in continuous development. So, for those who wish to revisit the basics when feeling overwhelmed by code, this is for you. 
The purpose is therefore to provide a reference point to go back to or to start from when buildning your future webshop.
